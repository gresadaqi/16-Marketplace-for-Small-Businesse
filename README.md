# Marketplace for Small Businesses in Kosovo

## Project Overview
This project is a **mobile application prototype** built with **React Native using the Expo framework**.  
The main idea is to create a **digital marketplace** that connects **small businesses in Kosovo** with potential customers, allowing them to **promote and sell their products online** in a simple and modern way.

The app is currently in its **first development phase (prototype stage)**, focusing on **design, navigation flow, and basic functionalities** such as product display, cart management, and simple UI interaction.


## Project Idea
Many small businesses in Kosovo struggle with limited online visibility and lack of resources to build their own e-commerce platforms.  
Our app aims to **bridge that gap** by providing a **mobile-friendly marketplace** where local businesses can:

- Create a profile for their shop  
- Upload and manage products  
- Reach more local customers online  

Customers can:

- Browse products from various small businesses  
- Add items to their cart  
- Support local entrepreneurs through local shopping  

The ultimate goal is to **empower small businesses** and contribute to the **digital growth of Kosovo’s economy**.


## Current Stage: Prototype (Phase 1)
At this stage, the app includes:

- Basic navigation (Home, Cart, Profile)  
- Sample data for businesses and products  
- Responsive design for different devices  
- UI prototype for testing and presentation
